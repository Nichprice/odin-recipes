    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 half in. bone in pork chops</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbs plus 1/4 c. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zest finely grated, plus 2 tbs fresh juice</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tbs dijon mustard (we like grey poupon)</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch of cilantro leaves w/ tender stems, chopped (optional!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prep</h3>
        <p>Take pork chops out of refridegerator ~1-2 hours before cooking. Generously salt 
        and peper both sides. Leave chops out to let them reach room temp.</p>
        <p>We recommend using a cast iron pan for cooking. Have ingredients prepped and ready for 
        vinagrette before the chops hit the pan. Vinagrette will be prepared while</p>
        <p>chops are cooking.</p>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>    
        <ul>
            <h4><li>Step 1</li></h4>
                <p>Season pork chops generously on one side with salt and pepper. Turn and season
                other side generously, then sprinkle evenly with ½ tsp. sugar.</p>
            <h4><li>Step 2</li></h4>
                <p>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Carefully add chops sugared 
                side down and cook, gently shaking skillet occasionally but not disturbing pork, </p>
                <p>until underside is caramelized and chops are deeply browned all over, about 5 minutes.
                Turn chops and reduce heat to low. Cook just until second side is opaque, about 1 minute. </p>
                <p>Remove skillet from heat and let chops rest 10 minutes in skillet (the cooking will carry 
                over and finish the chops while they rest).</p>
            <h4><li>Step 3</li></h4>
                <p>Meanwhile, whisk lemon zest and juice, garlic, mustard, oregano, cumin, and remaining ½ tsp. 
                sugar in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk in remaining ¼ cup oil until emulsified. Fold in </p>
                <p>cilantro and season with salt and lots of pepper.</p>
            <h4><li>Step 4</li></h4>
                <p>Spoon half of dressing onto a platter. Transfer chops to platter, then whisk any juices
                that have accumulated in skillet into remaining dressing. Spoon dressing over top of pork. </p>
                <p>Swipe pork through dressing as you eat.</p>
        </ul>
